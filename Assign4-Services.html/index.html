            >Peacocks are actually the males of a species called peafowl, which
            are native to Asian forests. Peafowl are a type of pheasant and are
            capable of flight. Female peafowl, called peahens, have brown
            feathers and shorter tails, which camouflage them and help them fly
            more easily than males.

            boar. It is territorial and generally a social predator.

          <span class="know">
            Hornbills (Bucerotidae) are a family of bird found in tropical and
            subtropical Africa, Asia and Melanesia. They are characterized by a
            long, down-curved bill which is frequently brightly coloured and
            sometimes has a casque on the upper mandible. Both the common
            English and the scientific name of the family refer to the shape of
            the bill
